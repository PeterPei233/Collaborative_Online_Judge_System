# 1.OverView 

- Implemented a web-based collaborative code editor which supports multiple user editing simultaneously (ACE, Socket.io, Redis);
- Designed and developed a single-page web application for coding problems (Angular2, Express, Node.js, MongoDB);
- Built a user-code executor service which can build and execute userâ€™s code (Docker, Flask);
- Refactored and Improved system throughput by decoupling services using RESTful API and loading balancing by Nginx (REST AP)

# 3. Back End

### 3.1 Tools:
- RESTful API: user can GET and POST problems from server using RESTful API
- Express
- socket.io: supporting collaborarive coding
- ACE: embeded editor components
- MongoDB: mLab as our Database
- Redis: Store and restore socket sessions 
- Flask: Executor service, physically isolate the normal node server and user-code execution
- docker: container where we test codes (We didn't really compile codes, we just send message back to client after we receive codes)
- nginx: workload balance(didn't implement this part for we don't have many users)
